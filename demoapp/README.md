# Malwarelytics Cordova Demo Application

## Before you start - Prerequisities

1. Cordova requires Java 11 to be set for the shell (command line) you're about to use.
2. [Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) on your computer (if not already installed).
3. Install cordova (if not already installed) via `npm install -g cordova`.
4. Get credentials for accessing Wultra Artifactory which hosts native SDKs that Malwarelytics for Cordova depends on.
5. Fill the credentials inside the `demoapp/malwarelytics.xml`.

> All the credentials and URL configurations are available in Malwarelytis web console under "Get Thee SDK" section.

## Build and run the app

### The simple way

We prepared simple "do-it-all" script that, if you met all prerequisities, will prepare, build and run the app.

Simply use following command inside the `demoapp` folder:
```
npm run prepareAndRunOnEmulator
```
to build and start the app on the emulator

or

```
npm run prepareAndRunOnDevice
```
to build and start the app on the device. __Make sure that your device is connected.__

### Step by step

2. Run `npm install` to install all npm packages
3. Prepare android version with `npm run prepareAndroid` command.
4. Install malwarelytics plugin by running `npm run installPlugin`
5. Run the app on device with `npm run startDevice` or emulator `npm run startEmulator`
