# Android Antivirus - Smart Protection

An app can integrate Malwarelytics for Android in a various degrees of customization.
On one extreme it can use its raw APIs - observers and method calls - and implement
all the app behaviours. On the other extreme it can integrate the SDK "hassle-free"
and use the built in **Smart Protection**.

**Smart Protection** is a set of automatic behaviours, that are enabled by default.
They involve timed evaluations of the installed apps, suggestion updates, initial scans
and automatic evaluation of app changes.

There are two basic modes of operation:

1. *Silent mode* - Turned on by default. Does not show any UI. It simply keeps the data up-to-date
with the remote console.

2. *Non-silent mode* - Involves automatic mitigations of detected threats.

Available automatic threat mitigations:

- Displaying app screen with list of dangerous apps.
- Displaying notification about a dangerous app.


## Configuring Smart Protection

Smart Protection can be configured in the initial cordova SDK initialization:

```js
await window.plugins.malwarelytics.initialize({
    // Configuration for the Android platform
    androidConfig: {
        antivirus: { // Configuration of the antivirus component
            enableSilentMode: false, // Silent mode enabled = no UI
            onlineCheckIntervalHours: 48, // check for update every 48 hours
            updateOnInitialize: true // the virus database will be updated on the startup
        }
    }
}
```

Threat mitigation UI of the smart protection can be [customized](./UI-Configuration-Android-Antivirus.md)
in the `malwarelytics.xml`.
